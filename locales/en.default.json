        "text1": "When I first met Mr. Kawasaki, I was without a team, having spent a year off the track. For a race car driver, a year without racing often spells retirement. Returning to racing is challenging, and outperforming past achievements is even harder. However, Mr. Kawasaki inspired me, saying, “If we work together, let's aim to compete in the world's best races. Let's win the GT300 Class championship.” With this ambitious goal, he began my treatments.htmlbrhtmlbrThe impact of Mr. Kawasaki's treatments varies for each individual, but for me, they brought two significant changes that drove my success in the series championship.",
        "text2": "The first change was enhanced concentration. Inside a race car, summer temperatures can reach 70 to 80 degrees Celsius, and drivers wear helmets and flame-retardant suits. These extreme conditions can lead to exhaustion, causing up to a 5kg weight loss after a race. Even a brief lapse in focus can result in a crash and diminished performance. Thanks to Mr. Kawasaki’s treatments, my concentration now endures throughout a 90-minute race, allowing me to unleash my full potential.htmlbrhtmlbrThe second transformation was in my field of vision. Clear vision is crucial for racers, and Mr. Kawasaki’s treatments sharpened and expanded my vision. Remarkably, I achieved identical lap times at night as during the day—a feat unusual in racing due to typically poorer nighttime visibility.htmlbrhtmlbrFinally, though it may seem unbelievable, Mr. Kawasaki’s treatments even reduce the size of my head.htmlbrhtmlbrAs a race car driver, I wear a helmet on every track outing. After treatments from Mr. Kawasaki, my helmet fits loosely, requiring extra foam padding to ensure a snug fit.htmlbrhtmlbrToday, I have no negative feelings about myself. Thanks to Mr. Kawasaki, my motivation is high, and I’m a positive thinker, feeling that nothing is impossible. I am committed to working with Mr. Kawasaki, aspiring to become a world champion."
